			<p id="one">In general we did all most of the basics of engineering, kind
				of mixed with computer science too. We did programming/coding on Python,
				HTML and CSS. In python, we did an assignment of a winter Scene, in which
				we coded the wither scene and did animations on it. For HTML and CSS, we
				made a website as our summative in six days.
				<br>
				<br>
				We did Basic Electronics which includes Engineering Notations and three
				kinds of circuits; Series, Parallel, and Series-Parallel circuits. We
				had quizzes and assignments in which we had to make circuits and analyze
				them. We also had a unit test for it at the end.
				<br>
				<br>
				Next we worked with a robot called Finch, we got some basic codes, we
				had to analyze them and change some aspects of it, and in the end of
				the unit we did a presentation in pairs. I liked this unit as we
				actually worked with a robot but this unit was really short, which was sad.
				<br>
				<br>
				We did Digital Electronics next, my favorite unit. Digital Electronics
				includes, Number System, Logic Gates, Boolean Expressions, Truth Table
				and K-Maps. In number Systems we converted hexa-decimal numbers,
				octal-decimal numbers and binary-decimal numbers. We learnt different
				types of Logic Gates like ‘AND’ ‘OR’ ‘NOR’ ‘NAND’ and more. We converted
				Boolean Equations to Truth tables, made Logic Diagrams and vice versa.
				We had some quizzes between the Unit.
				<br>
				<br>
				The last unit was HTML and CSS, we watched some videos on
				<a href=” http://www.littlewebhut.com/” >Little Web Hut </a> and did
				some tutorials on <a href=” http://www.w3schools.com/”> W3School </a>.
				It wasn’t hard to understand HTML or CSS, I kind of liked it. In the
				website we had to write about what we did and put screen shots of our
				Traffic Light assignment.
